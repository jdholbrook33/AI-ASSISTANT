# AI-ASSISTANT


**Stack Summary for the Local LLM-based Assistant:**

- **LLM Backend**: Ollama with a small LLM model (e.g., Mistral-1.5B or LLaMA-2 7B fine-tuned).
- **Agent System**: Python scripts for specific tasks (e.g., email management, order tracking).
- **Task Orchestration**: FastAPI/Flask for the Controller (handles LLM commands and routes tasks to agents).
- **Voice Integration** (Future): Whisper for Speech-to-Text, PyAudio for voice input, Text-to-Speech (TTS).
- **Interface**: Text-based command line interface initially, with a possible expansion to a simple local web UI.
- **Security**: Manage API keys/passwords with environment variables (`python-dotenv`).

**Quick Breakdown of Steps to Get Started:**

1. **Set Up Ollama and LLM**: Install Ollama on your local machine and load the desired model (e.g., Mistral-1.5B).
2. **Create Agents**: Write Python scripts for tasks like checking emails (`imaplib`, `yagmail`) and order processing (`shopify-python-api`).
3. **Controller Implementation**: Set up a FastAPI or Flask application to act as the orchestrator/controller between LLM and agents.
4. **LLM Command Integration**: Set up a simple interface where the LLM outputs commands in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and the Controller routes to the appropriate agent.
5. **Basic Functionality Testing**: Test the core tasks (like email checking) to ensure proper communication between components.
6. **Git Repo Setup**: Commit your code to a Git repository to track progress and facilitate further development.
7. **Voice Assistant (Optional Future Step)**: Integrate **Whisper** and **PyAudio** to extend the assistantâ€™s capabilities for voice activation.

**Suggested Prompt to Use When You Come Back to This Project:**

"Hey, I was working on building a local LLM-based personal assistant using Ollama for inference, with agents to manage tasks like email and order checking. I have a stack with Python scripts for agents, a Flask/FastAPI controller, and plan to eventually add voice activation. Can you help me continue or expand on the project with specific guidance or code examples for [insert specific task here]?"

This prompt will help me recall exactly what you were working on and what tools you were using so we can jump right back in efficiently.
