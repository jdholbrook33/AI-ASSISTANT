# AI-ASSISTANT


**Stack Summary for the Local LLM-based Assistant:**

- **LLM Backend**: Ollama with a small LLM model (e.g., Mistral-1.5B or LLaMA-2 7B fine-tuned).
- **Agent System**: Python scripts for specific tasks (e.g., email management, order tracking, email reply generation, ToDo app integration).
- **Task Orchestration**: FastAPI/Flask for the Controller (handles LLM commands and routes tasks to agents).
- **Voice Integration**: ChatGPT Voice API for direct Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech, bypassing Whisper and PyAudio. The assistant listens, interprets, and replies with both text for agent action and speech for user interaction.
- **Interface**: Text-based command line interface initially, with a possible expansion to a simple local web UI and full voice integration.
- **Security**: Manage API keys/passwords with environment variables (`python-dotenv`).

**Quick Breakdown of Steps to Get Started:**

1. **Set Up Ollama and LLM**: Install Ollama on your local machine and load the desired model (e.g., Mistral-1.5B).
2. **Create Agents**: Write Python scripts for tasks like checking emails (`imaplib`, `yagmail`), order processing (`shopify-python-api`), generating email replies, and managing a ToDo app.
3. **Controller Implementation**: Set up a FastAPI or Flask application to act as the orchestrator/controller between LLM and agents.
4. **LLM Command Integration**: Set up a simple interface where the LLM outputs commands in a structured format (e.g., JSON) and the Controller routes to the appropriate agent.
5. **Basic Functionality Testing**: Test the core tasks (like email checking, reply generation, and ToDo management) to ensure proper communication between components.
6. **Git Repo Setup**: Commit your code to a Git repository to track progress and facilitate further development.
7. **Voice Assistant Integration**: Integrate **ChatGPT Voice API** for fast voice interaction. Use the API's built-in capability for Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) to interact with the user while sending actionable text commands to agents, without the need for additional tools like Whisper or PyAudio.

**Steps to Generate a Reply to an Email:**

1. **User Command**: User provides a command such as "Generate a reply to the email from [sender] regarding [topic]."
2. **Email Retrieval**: The email-checking agent retrieves the specific email based on the provided details (e.g., sender and subject).
3. **Context Extraction**: Extract the context from the email, including key details, tone, and specific requests.
4. **LLM Reply Generation**: Pass the extracted context to the LLM to generate a draft reply. The LLM uses the email content and context to craft a suitable response.
5. **User Confirmation**: Present the draft reply to the user for confirmation or editing before sending.
6. **Send Email**: Once approved, the email management agent sends the reply using an SMTP service (`yagmail` or similar).

**Steps to Create and Use a ToDo App Integration:**

1. **ToDo App Setup**: Create a simple ToDo app using a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite) or an existing tool with an API (like Notion, Todoist, or a custom Flask app).
2. **API Integration**: Develop a REST API for the ToDo app, exposing endpoints to add, update, delete, and retrieve tasks. Alternatively, use an existing app's API.
3. **Agent Integration**: Write a Python script that interacts with the ToDo app API. This agent will be able to add notes or tasks to specific projects.
4. **LLM Command Processing**: Enable the LLM to generate structured commands that specify actions to be taken with the ToDo app, such as "add a task to [project]".
5. **Example Interaction**: User provides a voice or text command like "Jarvis, the Analog amp is working but still has some static in it. Please make a note of this in the Leak Detector project."
6. **Agent Execution**: The Controller invokes the ToDo app agent, which then interacts with the API to add a note or task to the appropriate project.
7. **Database Update**: The ToDo app agent runs the necessary SQL (e.g., inserting the note into the "Leak Detector" project's notes section).
8. **Confirmation**: The LLM provides a confirmation back to the user, such as "I've added a note to the Leak Detector project about the Analog amp's static issue." **(This confirmation can be given via text or voice using the ChatGPT Voice API).**

**Suggested Prompt to Use When You Come Back to This Project:**

"Hey, I was working on building a local LLM-based personal assistant using Ollama for inference, with agents to manage tasks like email and order checking. I have a stack with Python scripts for agents, a Flask/FastAPI controller, and plan to eventually add voice activation using the ChatGPT Voice API. I also want to integrate a ToDo app for project management. Can you help me continue or expand on the project with specific guidance or code examples for [insert specific task here]?"

This prompt will help me recall exactly what you were working on and what tools you were using so we can jump right back in efficiently.
